  <!-- <span title="Through this website, I intended to emulate the experience of a vintage circus. Specifically, I tried to make the website fun and enticing for the viewer, similar to if they were to visit a real circus. Although no real
        circus acts are depicted on the website due to my inability to capture live footage myself, I tried to create a similar experience through the inclusion of performance posters."><button class="statement">About (hover over)</button></span> -->
