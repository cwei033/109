  <p>
    The Birple is a name which originates from the combination of birb and apple. Whereas apple is self-explanatory, birb is a colloquial term referring to birds that are both cute and round. In the scope of worldbuilding, the Birple is a new species of birds evolutionized to resemble apples for camouflaging purposes. While the Birple's main body is red and yellow like an apple, its wings are designed to resemble green foliage. When the Birples are resting in a tree, they tend to remain stationary for the most part (although there are of course outliers) lest hunters spot and harm them. <br><br>
    This project is created using a combination of three.js's orbitControls, gltfLoader, and fontLoader. The peek-a-boo animation of the Birple is keyframed in Blender beforehand before being uploaded to three.js.
