      <h1 id="abouth1">Clover Field | About</h1>
      <p id="aboutp">Clover Field is an interactive website centered on the idea of emulating a clover field. Users must drag and drop clovers around in seek of the elusive four-leaf clovers, with there being five in total on the canvas. Once a
        four-leaf clover is found, the user will then be asked to input their wish in hopes of it coming true. <br><br>Clover Field is intended to be a calming experience whereupon users can relax and enjoy a mundane game of sorting and finding while
        accompanied by soft music. For their efforts in playing, the users are rewarded with a sense of hope that their wishes will be fulfilled by the found four-leaf clover. In terms of the technical, the website is created using a combination of
        Createjs's Easeljs and Soundjs. Whereas Easeljs is used for its drag-and-drop function, Soundjs is used for the sound effect the clovers make when they are clicked on.<br><br> Credits:<br>Background Music | <a
