  <p>//white space is a website designed to instill calmness in its visitors through sound and visual. Specifically, the two modes of //white space (static mode and flow mode) both feature different white noise sounds as well as accompanying visuals. Static mode focuses on the static white noise of a television screen, which I personally consider to be a drowning sensation in the sense that there is nothing specific to focus on with the static yet it does the job of depriving the senses for the viewer. On the other hand, flow mode provides a more calming visual as opposed to the chaotic nature of static mode. Flow mode is accompanied by lone desert noises which I felt paired well with the airy quality of the Perlin flow field visual. On that note, the technical element I decided to focus on for this website is Perlin noise using p5.js. The visuals of the two modes are both created using Perlin noise in some capacity. The reason I chose this element to focus on is because it was something new I had never used before and I felt the continuous quality of Perlin noise, what with each generated value being influenced by the last and so on, would work well in the scope of instilling a sense of calmness since the flow is more natural and organic as opposed to randomly generated values.
